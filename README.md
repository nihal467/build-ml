## How it Works ?

1. Step 1 : Options are available for providing url and uploading from the local machine. User may choose any one from them.
2. Step 2 : After Pasting the url or choosing the image and click the submit button provided below.
3. Step 3 : You will be redirected to a page where results are shown with the image provided.
            - If the classifier identifies it as a Mango it will display "I think its a Manga",
            - If the classifier identifies it as a Jackfruit it will display "I think its a Chakka"
4. Step 4 : You can click Go back button and repeat the process to see how the model performs for other images.

## Libraries used

- Tensorflow - 2.4.1
- Numpy      - 1.19.2
- Flask      - 1.1.2


## How to configure

- Download the whole project and keep it in a folder. 
- Install the libraries defined above(I use anaconda so the command is "conda install package-name"). 
- Navigate to the newly made folder using cmd. 
- Activate the tensorflow environment (Iam using Anaconda so the command is like "conda activate name-of-environment"). 

## How to Run
After activating the tensorflow environment excecute the following command in the cmd.
  - set FLASK_ENV=development
  - flask run
